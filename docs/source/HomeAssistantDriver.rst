Home Assistant Driver
=====================

The Home Assistant driver enables VOLTTRON to read any data point from any Home Assistant controlled device.
Currently control(write access) is supported only for lights(state and brightness) and thermostats(state and temperature).

The following diagram shows interaction between platform driver agent and home assistant driver.

Driver Config
=============

In the driver config file you must enter your Home Assistant IP, access token, and port. Those can be found `here <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token>`_.
Also make sure registry_config points to the name of your registry stored in the configuration store.

Here is an example configuration file.

.. code-block:: json
{
   "driver_config": {
       "ip_address": "Your Home Assistant IP",
       "access_token": "Your Home Assistant Access Token",
       "port": "Your Port"
   },
   "driver_type": "homeassistant",
   "registry_config": "config://light.example.json",
   "interval": 30,
   "timezone": "UTC"
}

Home Assistant Registry file.
=============

The registry file is a json file. Each JSON object relates to a state or attribute of a single device in Home Assistant. The Entity ID field is the entity we want to get, the Entity Attribute is the point that we want (such as state, brightness, or temperature), and the Volttron Point Name is the name that will display within VOLTTRON. This can be the same as the Entity Attribute if you use a seperate config and registry for each device. If you want to use one registry and one config for your entire setup, then you will need to create unique VOLTTRON point names. For example, if you have two lights that pull brightness, you might do something like brightness1 amd brightness2.

.. code-block:: json

   [
       {
           "Entity ID": "light.example",
           "Entity Attribute": "state",
           "Volttron Point Name": "light_state",
           "Units": "On / Off",
           "Units Details": "on/off",
           "Writable": true,
           "Starting Value": true,
           "Type": "boolean",
           "Notes": "lights hallway"
       },
       {
           "Entity ID": "light.example",
           "Entity Attribute": "brightness",
           "Volttron Point Name": "light_brightness",
           "Units": "int",
           "Units Details": "light level",
           "Writable": true,
           "Starting Value": 0,
           "Type": "int",
           "Notes": "brightness control, 0 - 255"
       }
   ]

   Installation
============

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

2. Install volttron and start the platform:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install volttron

    # Start platform with output going to volttron.log
    volttron -vv -l volttron.log &

3. Install the volttron platform driver:

.. code-block:: shell

    vctl install volttron-platform-driver --vip-identity platform.driver --start

4. Install the volttron home assistant library:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install volttron-lib-home-assistant-driver

5. Install a Fake Driver onto the Platform Driver:

   Installing a Home Assistant driver in the Platform Driver Agent requires adding copies of the device configuration and registry configuration files to the Platform Driverâ€™s configuration store.

6. Create a config directory and navigate to it:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir HAconfig
    cd HAconfig

7. Create a file named ``light.example.config`` and input your information:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "driver_config": {
            "ip_address": "Your Home Assistant IP",
            "access_token": "Your Home Assistant Access Token",
            "port": "Your Port"
        },
        "driver_type": "homeassistant",
        "registry_config": "config://light.example.json",
        "interval": 30,
        "timezone": "UTC"
    }

.. note::

    Ensure your ``registry_config`` parameter in your device configuration file, links to the correct registry config name in the config store. For more details on how volttron platform driver agent works with volttron configuration store see, `Platform driver configuration <https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/main/agent-framework/driver-framework/platform-driver/platform-driver.html#configuration-and-installation>`. Examples for lights and thermostats are provided below.

    Device configuration file contains the connection details to your home assistant instance and ``driver_type`` as "homeassistant". This file can be named anything you want but in this example we are naming it ``light.example.config``.

8. Create a file named ``light.example.json`` and enter your information. (*like the config, this file can be named anything and is only named light.example.json for demonstrative purposes*)

.. code-block:: json

    [
        {
            "Entity ID": "light.example",
            "Entity Attribute": "state",
            "Volttron Point Name": "light_state",
            "Units": "On / Off",
            "Units Details": "on/off",
            "Writable": true,
            "Starting Value": true,
            "Type": "boolean",
            "Notes": "lights hallway"
        },
        {
            "Entity ID": "light.example",
            "Entity Attribute": "brightness",
            "Volttron Point Name": "light_brightness",
            "Units": "int",
            "Units Details": "light level",
            "Writable": true,
            "Starting Value": 0,
            "Type": "int",
            "Notes": "brightness control, 0 - 255"
        }
    ]

9. Add light.example.config and light.example.json to the configuration store:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl config store platform.driver devices/home/bedroom HAconfig/light.example.config
    vctl config store platform.driver light.example.json HAconfig/light.example.json --json

10. Upon completion, utilize the listener agent to verify the driver output in the volttron.log:

.. code-block:: bash

    2023-09-12 11:37:00,226 (listeneragent-3.3 211531) __main__ INFO: Peer: pubsub, Sender: platform.driver:, Bus: , Topic: devices/BUILDING/ROOM/light.example/all, Headers: {'Date': '2023-09-12T18:37:00.224648+00:00', 'TimeStamp': '2023-09-12T18:37:00.224648+00:00', 'SynchronizedTimeStamp': '2023-09-12T18:37:00.000000+00:00', 'min_compatible_version': '3.0', 'max_compatible_version': ''}, Message:

        {'light_brightness': {'type': 'integer', 'tz': 'UTC', 'units': 'int'},
         'state': {'type': 'integer', 'tz': 'UTC', 'units': 'On / Off'}}]

.. note::

    Registry files can contain one single device and its attributes or a logical group of devices and its attributes. Each entry should include the full entity id of the device, including but not limited to home assistant provided prefix such as "light.",  "climate." etc. The driver uses these prefixes to convert states into integers. Like mentioned before, the driver can only control lights and thermostats but can get data from all devices controlled by home assistant.

    Each entry in a registry file should also have a 'Entity Attribute' and a unique value for 'Volttron Point Name'. The 'Entity ID' maps to the device instance, the 'Entity Attribute' extracts the attribute or state, and 'Volttron Point Name' determines the name of that point as it appears in VOLTTRON.

    Attributes can be located in the developer tools in the Home Assistant GUI.

.. note::

    When using a single registry file to represent a logical group of multiple physical entities, make sure the "Volttron Point Name" is unique within a single registry file.

    For example, if a registry file contains entities with id  'light.instance1' and 'light.instance2' the entry for the attribute brightness for these two light instances could have "Volttron Point Name" as 'light1/brightness' and 'light2/brightness' respectively. This would ensure that data is posted to unique topic names and brightness data from light1 is not overwritten by light2 or vice-versa.

    Example Thermostat Registry
===========================

For thermostats, the state is converted into numbers as follows: "0: Off, 2: heat, 3: Cool, 4: Auto",

.. code-block:: json

   [
      {
          "Entity ID": "climate.my_thermostat",
          "Entity Attribute": "state",
          "Volttron Point Name": "thermostat_state",
          "Units": "Enumeration",
          "Units Details": "0: Off, 2: heat, 3: Cool, 4: Auto",
          "Writable": true,
          "Starting Value": 1,
          "Type": "int",
          "Notes": "Mode of the thermostat"
      },
      {
          "Entity ID": "climate.my_thermostat",
          "Entity Attribute": "current_temperature",
          "Volttron Point Name": "volttron_current_temperature",
          "Units": "F",
          "Units Details": "Current Ambient Temperature",
          "Writable": true,
          "Starting Value": 72,
          "Type": "float",
          "Notes": "Current temperature reading"
      },
      {
          "Entity ID": "climate.my_thermostat",
          "Entity Attribute": "temperature",
          "Volttron Point Name": "set_temperature",
          "Units": "F",
          "Units Details": "Desired Temperature",
          "Writable": true,
          "Starting Value": 75,
          "Type": "float",
          "Notes": "Target Temp"
      }
   ]

Adding Features
===============

The VOLTTRON home assistant driver utilizes the `home assistant rest api <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/>`_ to pull states and attributes as well as control states and attributes. Currently, the VOLTTRON Home Assistant driver supports pulling all states and attributes from Home Assistant but only allows control of thermostats (state and temperature) and lights (state and brightness).

To add control for new devices, first understand the desired functionality and how VOLTTRON will interpret it. For instance, agents like ILC require a numeric value, so a string value such as "on" for a light must be converted into an integer. Below, see the driver's code converting the state of lights to 1 or 0. We assume that lights always start with ``.light``. When adding a new device, replace that with the device group's start. For instance, instead of ``.light``, use ``.switch``.

.. code-block:: python

    elif "light." in entity_id:
        if entity_point == "state":
            state = entity_data.get("state", None)
            # Converting light states to numbers.
            if state == "on":
                register.value = 1
                result[register.point_name] = 1
            elif state == "off":
                register.value = 0
                result[register.point_name] = 0

To add a new device such as a smart switch, we would likely have to do a similar thing. You can simply add a new elif statement in the _scrape_all function to retrieve data for this new device and convert the values (if needed).

To actually control these devices with VOLTTRON, we need to update the _set_point function. Below you will see where the driver takes these new numbers and takes action based on the new register value.

.. code-block:: python

    if "light." in register.entity_id:
    if entity_point == "state":
        if isinstance(register.value, int) and register.value in [0, 1]:
            if register.value == 1:
                self.turn_on_lights(register.entity_id)
            elif register.value == 0:
                self.turn_off_lights(register.entity_id)

Once we get this new value such as 0, we call the appropriate function to turn off the light in Home Assistant. You may use the existing control functions as reference but keep in mind that the Home Assistant REST API requires different URLs for different devices so please keep the documentation close when adding new control functions.
